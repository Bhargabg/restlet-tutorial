        <title>Using generics</title>
        <para>Restlet supports generics to modularize common processing. Let's tackle such aspects when implementing

</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>The one that handles element list and adding</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>The one that handles particular element</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
